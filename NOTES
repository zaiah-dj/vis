Creatively chop this up....

44100 samples / second (how do I find the most significant bits?)

20.5 kHz (really 16kHz) represents the theoretical limit of human hearing...

20 - 60 fps (60 is the browser's limit, 100 might be doable on a phone and on a desktop app if you really want it...)

every nth sample can be fed to something 


get pretty crazy with pipes (haxe, js, coffeescript, as3, etc.)


milliseconds pause with SDL_Delay
(can you read information from the userdata?)
(at the loops's fastest diff is called 1,000,000 times a second)
(1000 ms = 1 s)
(1000/


buffer is 4096 (so 40960)


SHIT TO KNOW
How many times is audio_callback called in a second?
- Is it 44100 times?
- Find out by putting some magic within the audio_callback function...

So what if you just drew the first 20.5k values?
- That SHOULD give you a waveform... or at least some kind of visualization of those human perceptible sounds
