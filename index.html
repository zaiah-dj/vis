vis

Vis is an audio visualizer.   It's primary use is to analyze wav files and make something out of them.  However, it's designed to be able to handle a variety of tasks and be extensible.  Enjoy!


Usage
-----
<p>
Here is the complete list of options thus far:
<pre>
    --log <arg>          Log files somewhere.
-l, --loop <arg>         Log files somewhere.
    --describe           Describe an audio stream.
-d, --dir <arg>          Save video files to <dir>.
-p, --play <arg>         Choose a file to play.
-r, --render <arg>       Render a session to file.
-s, --switch <arg>       Switch animations every <arg> seconds.
-f, --framerate <arg>    Use <arg> fps when rendering.
-n, --resolution <arg>   Use <arg> resolution.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The most important options are -p, -l and -f.  -p expects the name of a WAV file (for now, other file types will be supported in the future). If 'vis' has been compiled with the PLAY_EMBEDDED flag, it will discard any file name fed to it this way and instead use WAV data embedded in the source.   The -l flag puts vis in loop mode, looping either input supplied by you via the -p flag or the embedded WAV data.  Finally, -f controls frame rate of animations to music.  The default is something paltry like 20 fps.  On most modern systems, 80 fps is a reachable limit.  If you are at any possible of epilepsy, <b>do not go above 40 frames per second</b>.
</p>



Extension
---------
<p>
Right now, vis can be very easily extended by modifying main.c.   The prototype of an animation function is as follows:
<pre>
void my_new_animation (Surface *w, Av *v) {
	/* ... the code for animation goes here ... */
}
</pre>
</p>


Caveats
-------
<p>
As mentioned in the 'Usage' section, people at risk for epileptic seizures should not crank this program to a high framerate.  Many of the effects used here are crude, ugly, and highly saturated with color (like anything from <a href="/">Paper Rad</a>).  To prevent any possible health issues, the Av struct contains a field titled 'no_epilepsy'.  If an animation has this field set, 'vis' will skip it.  It is a compile-time option and can be turned off with '-D=NO_EPILEPSY'.
