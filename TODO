x Loop (songs)

	Package an audio file in the thing

	Dump a waveform

	Read this same waveform	

	Save video...

	Faster...

x	More visuals...
		there are at least three, they are ugly
		sort by possible epileptic seizure stuff
		name and add metadata
		convert to Lua (or some other scripting language, to make it easy to pop files in)


	General
		add sample rate to Av
		there are a couple of other globals that should be added (b/c they're calculated...)
		ptr + 100 seems to be the start of audio, so looping is working for a particular tempo
		

	Input...

	- libtheora / libvorbisfile (packaged with app)
	- sqlite3 (select tracks and keep playlists and choose videos or code for animations (could be lua if you wanted))
	- embed wav files for tests (make em small with glib)

	===========

	Creatively chop this up....

	20.5 kHz (really 16kHz) represents the theoretical limit of human hearing...

	20 - 60 fps (60 is the browser's limit, 100 might be doable on a phone and on a desktop app if you really want it...)

	every nth sample can be fed to something 


	get pretty crazy with pipes (haxe, js, coffeescript, as3, etc.)


	milliseconds pause with SDL_Delay
	(can you read information from the userdata?)
	(at the loops's fastest diff is called 1,000,000 times a second)
	(1000 ms = 1 s)
	(1000/


	buffer is 4096 (so 40960)


	SHIT TO KNOW
	How many times is audio_callback called in a second?
	- Is it 44100 times?
	- Find out by putting some magic within the audio_callback function...

	So what if you just drew the first 20.5k values?
	- That SHOULD give you a waveform... or at least some kind of visualization of those human perceptible sounds
